# 🏆 TwinWeaver Hackathon Challenges

Welcome to the TwinWeaver Hackathon! These interactive notebooks are designed to test your understanding of clinical data processing and LLM fine-tuning for medical forecasting.

## 🎯 Challenge Format

Unlike the standard tutorials, these notebooks require **active participation**:

- **🔴 TODO Sections**: Code cells marked with `# TODO:` require you to write code
- **❓ Quiz Questions**: Test your understanding before moving forward
- **🧪 Experiments**: Design and run your own experiments
- **🏁 Checkpoints**: Verify your solutions before proceeding
- **🌟 Bonus Challenges**: Optional advanced tasks for extra credit

## 📚 Available Challenges

### Challenge 1: Data Preparation (`01_data_preparation_challenge.ipynb`)
**Difficulty**: ⭐⭐ (Intermediate)
**Time**: 45-60 minutes

Learn to transform raw clinical data into instruction-tuning format by:
- Configuring the data pipeline from scratch
- Understanding split strategies for patient timelines
- Debugging common configuration errors
- Experimenting with different forecasting targets

### Challenge 2: End-to-End LLM Fine-tuning (`02_llm_finetuning_challenge.ipynb`)
**Difficulty**: ⭐⭐⭐ (Advanced)
**Time**: 90-120 minutes

Master the complete LLM fine-tuning workflow by:
- Setting up training data generation
- Configuring LoRA hyperparameters
- Analyzing training dynamics
- Running inference experiments
- Evaluating model predictions

## 🚀 Getting Started

1. Make sure you have TwinWeaver installed: `pip install twinweaver`
2. For Challenge 2, also install: `pip install twinweaver[fine-tuning-example]`
3. Open the challenge notebook and follow the instructions
4. Don't peek at the solutions until you've tried!

## 💡 Tips for Success

- **Read the context**: Each section provides background information
- **Check the hints**: Stuck? Look for the 💡 hint markers
- **Run checkpoints**: Use the validation cells to verify your code
- **Experiment freely**: The bonus sections encourage exploration

## 📊 Scoring (Optional)

If running as a competition:
- Each TODO section: 10 points
- Each quiz question: 5 points
- Bonus challenges: 15-25 points each
- Clean, well-documented code: up to 10 bonus points

Good luck! 🍀
